# Croptation

Croptation is a freelance project I am currently working on for a local farmer. The program's purpose is to allow for easy and clear displaying of information about fields and their cropping history. Edit the data and on the next cycle include the ability to create crop rotations based on specified rules.

It also needs to produce different tables depending on what data is being requested.

I have previously done this on excel, but I am hoping this will be more efficient to update in the long run, will allow easier sorting of data and be a learning experience in the process.
